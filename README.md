## Mod Helper Tool
Simple yet powerful tool to help you manage your mods in several ways.

## Name
MHT and MOTH was already occupied by another projects, so **MO**d **H**elper **T**ool, `MOHT` in short was born. 
Anyway if you not pay attention to details or your english is not fluent (as mine) logo fits like a glove. 

## General
For now, application can only clean your mods, but in future more features will be added.

* Run Linux, Windows and Mac (not tested)
* Multithreading cleaning (faster) - only [PyQt5](#gui-pyqt5) version
* Two built-in version `tes3cmd` binary (0.40 and 0.37) - no additional downloads needed
* Allow to select custom `tes3cmd` executable file
* Select location of directory with Mods
* Select location of `Morrowind/Data Files` directory
* Simple report after cleaning

## Requirements
* Python 3.7+ (with tcl/tk support, see [GUI Tk](#gui-tk)) should be fine
* `PyQt5` for Qt GUI version, see [GUI PyQt5](#gui-pyqt5)
* Linux users require install additional [Perl module](#perl-module)
* Optional:
  * `pip` >= 22.2 - use to check new version of Moht

## Installation
1. Any Python version grater the 3.7 with tcl/tk support
2. Package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/moht/), open Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or any terminal and type:
   ```shell
   pip install moht
   ```
3. You can drag and drop `moht_tk.exe` (for `tkinter`) or `moht_qt.exe` (for `PyQt5`) to desktop and make shortcut (with custom icon, you can find icon in installation 
directory i.e. C:\Python310\lib\site-packages\moht\img\moht.ico).

## GUI PyQt5
You can use `PyQt5` version of GUI. You can [find](#start) executable called `moht_qt.exe` or script `moht_qt`.
This version will be actively develop and will get new features. In future will probably become the default option.

## GUI Tk
Application use `tkinter` (`tk` for short) of GUI as well. `Tk` is Python's built-in library for GUI. 
Right now this version is almost as functional as `Qt` version, however in future some differences can be introduced.
You can [find](#start) executable called `moht_tk.exe` or script `moht_tk`. However, sometimes `tk` isn't available by default:
  * Windows 10/11, during Python installation please select:  
    * Optional Features:
      * pip
      * tcl/tk and IDLE
      * py launcher
    * Advanced Options:
      * Associate files with Python (requires the py launcher)
      * Add Python to environment variables
      * Customize install location: C:\Python310 or C:\Python
  * Debian
    ```shell
    sudo apt install python3-tk
    ``` 
  * OpenSUSE
    ```shell
    sudo zypper install python3-tk
    ```

## Perl module
`perl-Config-IniFiles` is required for `tes3cmd-0.37` which Moht use to clean-up mods. Install with
  * Debian
    ```shell
    sudo apt install python3-tk
    ``` 
  * OpenSUSE
    ```shell
    sudo zypper install python3-tk
    ```
However, moht has v0.40 built-in as well which do not require perl package.

## Start
* Windows  
  You can find executable(s) with little trick, open Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and type:
  ```shell
  pip uninstall moht
  ```
  Note: answer **No** to question. It will show you, where Moht was installed. Usually pip should install moht into your Python directory: i.e.:
  ``` 
  C:\Python310\lib\site-packages\moht-0.6.2.dist-info\*
  C:\Python310\lib\site-packages\moht\*
  C:\Python310\scripts\moht.exe
  C:\Python310\scripts\moht_qt.exe
  C:\Python310\scripts\moht_tk.exe
  ```
* Linux  
  Simply run `moht_tk` or `moht_qt` from terminal

## Upgrade
To upgrade Moht to the latest version:
```shell
pip install -U moht
```

## Uninstall
```shell
pip install -qy moht
```
